# Stock Analyzer

## Task

This project creates a stock analyzer which gives information about fundamental attributes to enhance the decision-making to buy a stock. It consists of following sections:

- A header with links to various sections of the page
- A landing section covers fundamental concepts related to a stock to determine how a stock is performing
- A section to display a table of all the available stocks and facilitates to make them "favorite"
- A section to display OHLC(Open, close, high, low) values of your favorite stocks
- 'Compare section' shows a line chart of OHLC values of all your favorite stocks. It depicts variations which happen through out a day in stock's price.

Here I have used libraries like Chakra UI more polished and professional looking page. Referred: [documentation](https://chakra-ui.com/docs/components) and [React canvasJS](https://canvasjs.com/react-charts/) for showing the charts.

This project uses NodeJS backend and MongoDB to stock the stocks of user.
